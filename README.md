# 🎮 Java Shooting Game  

Welcome to my **Java Shooting Game**! 🚀 This is a simple yet exciting game built using **Java Swing** and **threads**, showcasing my journey into game development. The game is all about aiming, shooting, and scoring points by hitting falling objects.  

## 📝 Features  
- **Shooter Mechanics**: Fire bullets to hit targets. 🎯  
- **Falling Objects**: Randomly appearing objects descend on the canvas.  
- **Score Tracking**: Earn points for each successful hit. 🏆  
- **Smooth Animations**: Multithreaded rendering for seamless gameplay.  
- **Collision Detection**: Accurate hit recognition to score points.  

## 💡 What I Learned  
1. **Java Swing**: Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.  
2. **Multithreading**: Synchronizing game components for smooth animations.  
3. **Collision Detection**: Implementing logic to detect and respond to bullet hits.  
4. **Game Loop Design**: Structuring game updates and rendering efficiently.
