/*
 * Tile numbering format
 *	+ place all tile maps under /res/tiles directory 
 *	+ tile images must be named in the format "%03d.png". (i.e 000.png, 001.png, etc..)
 *	+ supports 200 tiles. (for ranges 200-399 .. 200 is substracted
 *		to get the actual tileID... and so on.)
 * 	+ if a tile image corresponding to an ID is not found, then a null tile will be placed
 *	+ tiles 0, 200, 400, 600 are assumed to be blank tiles, and hence
 *		tile filenames start from 001.png .. upto 199.png
